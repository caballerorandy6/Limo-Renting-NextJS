          Because we recognize that chauffeurs take on many roles, we insist on
          100 percent certification for anyone who wishes to drive with us.
          However, working as a chauffeur for American Transportation requires
          far more than a good driving record. It also demands exceptional
          customer service skills. Our company only hires friendly, outgoing,
          talented drivers who want to make a difference in someoneâ€™s day and
          event. We consider our chauffeurs to be logistical planning experts as
          much as drivers.
