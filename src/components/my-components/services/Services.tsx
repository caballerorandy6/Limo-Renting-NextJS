    text1:
      "Bachelor and bachelorette parties have long been a tradition for people getting married soon to have one last night on the town as a single person with their wedding party and closest friends. Rather than drive yourself or assign someone else to do it, consider working with a luxury Miami limo company such as American Transportation & Limo Services to get around town in style. For some people, a bachelor or bachelorette party wouldn’t be complete without inviting 29 of their closest friends for a night of barhopping and visiting nightclubs in a Miami party bus. While not all limo companies can handle such a large request, it’s no problem for us. In fact, our 30-passenger party bus is perfect for such an occasion. You and your group can party all night long, including while en route from one destination to the next. We’re here to serve you, so don’t hesitate to ask for what you need to make the evening complete. Whether it’s certain music, alcoholic beverages, movies, or another reasonable request, we can make it happen. Maybe partying with 30 people isn’t quite your speed. If so, we have many other vehicle options available to you. Our Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Limo, for example, offers bench seating and holds up to 12 passengers. It’s also easy to hop on and off if you have several stops planned for the bachelor or bachelorette party bus or limo booking. If your group is as small as seven people, you can choose from our classic Chevrolet Suburban or Cadillac Escalade ESV. For truly intimate transportation for your bachelor or bachelorette party, you can even book a three-passenger Cadillac XTS or Lexus E350.",
    text2:
      "As the second largest city in Florida, Miami offers a rich bar and nightclub scene. Your professional chauffeur would be happy to recommend specific locations to stop at for your bachelor or bachelorette party in Miami. Of course, you’re not limited to visiting these types of establishments. The night is all about you or your friend or relative getting married and the people in the wedding party. Whatever is fun for your group is exactly where our chauffeur will take them. According to Wedding Wire, any place in the South Beach area is the place to be when celebrating with just the guys or just the girls before an upcoming wedding. Even if bars and nightclubs aren’t your preference, the area has plenty to offer with many authentic Cuban restaurants and endless opportunities to play water sports. Many limo companies can’t help you plan an itinerary for your bachelorette party or bachelor party in Miami, but the local chauffeurs American Transportation can. At American Transportation, we understand this is an exciting time in life for everyone in the wedding party. We would hate to see anyone disappointed by not getting the luxury vehicle they want for the date they have chosen for a bachelor or bachelorette party. We encourage you to reserve early for this reason. Miami-area residents can reach us at 305-885-5003 and those outside of the area may call toll-free at 877-377-0347. Our entire staff looks forward to serving your group, and don’t forget that we can help with your Miami wedding transportation as well!",
